abstract: |
  Abstract to be written here. The abstract should not be too long and should provide the reader with a good understanding what you are writing about. Academic papers are not like novels where you keep the reader in suspense. To be effective in getting others to read your paper, be as open and concise about your findings here as possible. Ideally, upon reading your abstract, the reader should feel he / she must read your paper in entirety.

# Introduction \label{Introduction}

References are to be made as follows: @fama1997[p. 33] and @caspi2015 Such authors could also be referenced in brackets [@caspi2015] and together [@fama1997 \& @caspi2015]. Source the reference code from scholar.google.com by clicking on ``cite'' below article name. Then select BibTeX at the bottom of the Cite window, and proceed to copy and paste this code into your ref.bib file located in the directory's Tex folder. I suggest renaming the top line after \@article, as done in the template ref.bib file, to something more intuitive for you to remember. Do not change the rest of the code.


To reference a section, you have to set a label using ``\\label'' in R, and then reference it in-text as e.g.: section \ref{Data}.


Writing in Rmarkdown is surprizingly easy - see [this website](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf) cheatsheet for a summary on writing Rmd writing tips.

# Data \label{Data}

Discussion of data should be thorough with a table of statistics and ideally a figure. 

In your tempalte folder, you will find a Data and a Code folder. In order to keep your data files neat, store all of them in your Data folder. Also, I strongly suggest keeping this Rmd file for writing and executing commands, not writing out long pieces of data-wrangling. In the example below, I simply create a ggplot template for scatter plot consistency. I suggest keeping all your data 

```{r Figure1, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning =  FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "Caption Here \\label{Figure1}", fig.ext = 'png', fig.height = 3, fig.width = 6}

library("dplyr")
library("readr")
library("ggplot2")
library("ggthemes")


if (!file.exists(file.path(getwd(), "Code/Example_Plot_Scatter.R"))) {
  # This is just a random plot to show you a plot. This is done if the getwd() does not point to your Template's directory.
  # Set WD below to your project's working directory.
  
  g <-
  ggplot(data = mtcars %>% tbl_df()) + # All data must be tbl_df()::: class(mtcars %>% tbl_df())
  geom_point(aes(x = disp, y = hp, color = cyl)) +
  theme_bw() +
  # theme(legend.position = "none") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 10)) +
  theme(axis.title = element_text(size = 10), 
        axis.title.x = element_text()) +
  ylab("y-axis") +
  xlab("x-axis")

print(g)  

} else {

# ----------  Using your Code and Data folders to manage your Template:
#------------------- To make this work, change WD to your project's directory:

  WD <- getwd()

# Load Example Data using read_csv from Hadley Wickham (or other csv reading methods of your choice):
ExampleData <- read_csv( file.path(WD, "Data/ExampleData.csv") )

source( file.path(WD, "Code/Example_Plot_Scatter.R") ) # Load a function from your 'Code' folder. This e.g. plots scatters to your own preferences.
source( file.path(WD, "Code/Data_Create.R") ) # 

ExampleData <- Data_Create(N = 100) # Same as the ExampleData loaded above - this is just a function to create the stored data.

g <- Example_Plot_Scatter(DataInput = ExampleData, 
                          X = "Height_Score",
                          Y = "Weight_Score",
                          Z = "Agility_Score",
                          Theme = theme_bw(), # run ?ggthemes for other themes. 
                          Title = "", # I prefer to use the caption set above. 
                          Ylab = "Height", 
                          Xlab = "Lenght",
                          LegendTitle = "Agility",
                          TitleSize = 10, 
                          LabSize = 10)

print(g)

  
}


# Although the functions above are really simple, the principle is simple: containing calculations and data wrangling in their own functions will make this template much cleaner and manageable. 

# When you start working, please delete these meaningless functions...

```

To reference the plot above, add a ``\\label'' after the caption in the chunk heading, as done above. Then reference the plot as such: As can be seen, figure \ref{Figure1} is excellent. The nice thing now is that it correctly numbers all your figures (and sections or tables) and will update if it moves. The links are also dynamic.

I very strongly suggest using ggplot2 (ideally in combination with dplyr) using the ggtheme package to change the themes of your figures.

Also note the information that I have placed above the chunks in the code chunks for the figures. You can edit any of these easily - visit the Rmarkdown webpage for more information.

Here follows another figure from built-in ggplot2 data:

```{r figure2, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning =  FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "Diamond Cut Plot \\label{lit}", fig.ext = 'png', fig.height = 3, fig.width = 6}

g <-
ggplot(diamonds, aes(depth, fill = cut, colour = cut)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.3) +
  theme_bw()

print(g)  

```


#  Methodology

## Subsection
Ideally do not overuse subsections. It equates to bad writing.^[This is an example of a footnote by the way. Something that should also not be overused.]

## Math section

Equations should be written as such:

\begin{align} 
\beta = \sum_{i = 1}^{\infty}\frac{\alpha^2}{\sigma_{t-1}^2} \label{eq1} \\ 
\int_{x = 1}^{\infty}x_{i} = 1 \notag
\end{align}


Note again the reference to equation \ref{eq1}. Writing nice math requires practice. Note I used a forward slashes to make a space in the equations. I can also align equations using ``\&'', and set to numbering only the first line. Here follows a more complicated equation:


\begin{align} 
	y_t &= c + B(L) y_{t-1} + e_t   \label{eq2}    \\ \notag 
	e_t &= H_t^{1/2}  z_t ; \quad z_t \sim  N(0,I_N) \quad \& \quad H_t = D_tR_tD_t \\ \notag
		D_t^2 &= {\sigma_{1,t}, \dots, \sigma_{N,t}}   \\ \notag
		\sigma_{i,t}^2 &= \gamma_i+\kappa_{i,t}  v_{i, t-1}^2 +\eta_i  \sigma_{i, t-1}^2, \quad \forall i \\ \notag
		R_{t, i, j} &= {diag(Q_{t, i, j}}^{-1}) . Q_{t, i, j} . diag(Q_{t, i, j}^{-1})  \\ \notag
		Q_{t, i, j} &= (1-\alpha-\beta)  \bar{Q} + \alpha  z_t  z_t'  + \beta  Q_{t, i, j} \notag
\end{align}

Noten that in \ref{eq2} I have aligned the equations by the equal signs. I also want only one tag, and I create spaces using ``quads''. 

See if you can figure out how to do complex math using the two examples provided in \ref{eq1} and \ref{eq2}

# Results


Tables can be included as follows. Use the _xtable_ package for tables. Table placement = H implies Latex tries to place the table Here, and not on a new page.


```{r ShortTable, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, results = 'asis'}

library(xtable)
data = mtcars[1:5,] %>% tbl_df()

table <- xtable(data, caption = "Short Table Example \\label{tab1}")
  print.xtable(table, 
             # tabular.environment = "longtable",
             floating = TRUE,
             table.placement = 'H', 
             # scalebox = 0.3, 
             comment = FALSE,
             caption.placement = 'bottom'
             )

```

To reference calculations __in text__, _do this:_ From table \ref{tab1} we see the average value of mpg is `r mean(mtcars[1:5,]$mpg)`.

Including tables that span across pages, use e.g.:

```{r LongTable, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, results = 'asis'}

library(xtable)
data = mtcars %>% tbl_df()
table <- xtable(data, caption = "Long Table Example")
  print.xtable(table, 
             tabular.environment = "longtable",
             floating = FALSE,
             table.placement = 'H', 
             comment = FALSE, caption.placement = 'bottom'
             )
# See https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/xtable/vignettes/xtableGallery.pdf for table inspiration
```
